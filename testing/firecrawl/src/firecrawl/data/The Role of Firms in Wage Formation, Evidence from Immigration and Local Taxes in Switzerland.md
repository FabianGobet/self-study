The Role of Firms in Wage Formation: Evidence from Immigration and Local Taxes in Switzerland

Research Context and Scope

This ongoing study examines how firms influence wage formation in the context of two distinct economic factors: immigration and local taxation ￼. The research is set in Switzerland, a country with rich employer–employee data and significant variation in both immigration patterns and local income tax rates. By focusing on Switzerland, the project leverages a setting where detailed administrative data are available (e.g. tax records and social security data), allowing for precise analysis of wage dynamics at the firm level. The scope encompasses:
• Immigration Shocks: How inflows (or restrictions) of foreign workers impact the allocation of workers across firms and the wage structure.
• Local Tax Differences: How variations in municipal income taxes affect labor market outcomes, such as wages and employment, and whether firms play a role in absorbing or passing on these tax effects.

By integrating these two facets, the project seeks to deepen understanding of the critical role firms play in shaping wage structures and other labor outcomes beyond individual worker characteristics ￼. In sum, it addresses the broader question: to what extent do firms mediate external economic shocks (like immigration or tax changes) in the determination of wages and employment?

Main Goals and Objectives

The study has two primary objectives, corresponding to its two thematic parts ￼:
• 1) Impact of Immigration & Shocks on Wage Structure: Examine how immigration and related economic shocks influence labor market outcomes. In particular, the researchers analyze how immigrants and native workers sort into firms, how wages adjust across different firms, and how well immigrants economically integrate in the presence of such shocks ￼. This involves determining whether immigration changes lead to wage disparities between firms (for instance, do some firms raise wages or hire differently when immigrant labor supply changes?) and how native and immigrant workers redistribute across employers in response.
• 2) Effect of Local Income Taxes on Labor Markets: Investigate how variation in local income tax rates across Swiss municipalities affects wages, employment, and worker mobility, and crucially whether these effects operate through firm behavior ￼. This objective aims to identify if firms offset local tax differences by adjusting gross wages or other compensation, and how tax-induced incentives might influence the hiring or location decisions of firms and workers. Essentially, it asks: who bears the burden of local income taxes – employers or employees – and does firm wage-setting mitigate or exacerbate those tax effects on workers?

These goals reflect a unifying theme: assessing how much firms matter in determining outcomes that classical models might attribute purely to supply and demand. By fulfilling these objectives, the project will clarify whether external forces like migration and taxation have direct effects on workers or if their effects are channeled and modulated by firms (e.g., via wage policies or hiring practices).

Data and Methodology

Data Sources: The research draws on exceptionally detailed Swiss data. According to the project description, the team compiles comprehensive matched employer–employee datasets and links them with external data on taxes and demographics. In particular, they leverage individual and firm-level records from Swiss administrative sources (e.g. social security employment histories or tax records). For the taxation analysis, they use municipality-level tax schedule data from the Swiss federal tax authority (EFV), which enables the researchers to compute precise income tax liabilities for individuals based on where they live ￼. This granular tax data is combined with wage and employment information, providing a foundation to analyze how net-of-tax wage considerations enter firm and worker decisions. Lastly, local economic indicators and immigration statistics are used to identify immigration shocks and to measure economic integration outcomes.

Identification Strategy: Each part of the study employs a quasi-experimental empirical strategy to isolate causality:
• Immigration Shock Analysis: The researchers exploit a specific policy change or event that restricted immigration as a natural experiment. This “immigration limitation policy” serves as an exogenous shock to labor supply. By comparing labor market outcomes before vs. after the policy, and between regions or firms more or less exposed to the change, they can identify its effect on wages and employment. The analysis likely uses a difference-in-differences framework, examining how firms with varying reliance on immigrant workers adjusted their wages, hiring, or workforce composition when the shock occurred. Early conference presentations confirm that this analysis focuses on unexpected outcomes of an immigration policy in Switzerland ￼. The team likely examines metrics such as wage growth for native workers, changes in hiring rates or job vacancies, and any reallocation of workers between firms.
• Local Tax Variation Analysis: To study tax impacts, the project takes advantage of Switzerland’s variation in local (municipal) income tax rates. The methodology may involve comparing similar workers or firms across municipal boundaries with different tax rates (a spatial comparison) or analyzing changes over time when a municipality adjusts its tax rate. A plausible strategy is a tax incidence analysis using either event studies (for tax changes) or regression discontinuities at locality borders. The key is to observe whether workers in high-tax locations receive higher gross wages (suggesting firms compensate for the tax), or whether firms in low-tax areas attract more workers due to higher net pay, etc. By integrating firm data, the study can detect if firm wage policies respond to local tax differences. For example, the researchers can observe if two workers with identical skills but working at the same firm receive different pay because one lives in a high-tax town and the other in a low-tax town – evidence that firms might adjust pay to equalize after-tax income. Alternatively, they may look at firm-level outcomes (like staffing or talent composition) when local taxes change, checking if firms pass the costs to employees or absorb them. The goal is to determine whether the effect of local taxes on wages/employment is mediated by firms (through wage adjustments or firm location choices) or mainly by worker decisions (such as relocating or commuting).

Analytical Approach: In both parts, the study uses econometric modeling to control for confounding factors. For immigration effects, controls would include overall economic trends and local conditions; for taxes, fixed effects for regions or individuals help isolate tax rate impacts. The project’s design, as funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, emphasizes credible identification of causal effects. The researchers also integrate firm heterogeneity into the analysis – recognizing that firms differ in productivity, bargaining power, or willingness to pay, which can all influence wage formation. By interacting the external shocks with firm-level characteristics, the study can reveal which types of firms are most influential in setting wages under pressure from immigration or tax changes.

Key Findings and Preliminary Results

Because this is a work in progress (running through 2027) ￼, only preliminary findings have been made public so far. However, early evidence and presentations shed light on notable outcomes for each part of the project:
• Effects of an Immigration Restriction: Initial results from the immigration-policy analysis indicate unexpected impacts on labor demand and wages ￼. In a recent academic workshop, the team even titled their analysis “Unexpected Labor Demand Responses to an Immigration Limitation Policy,” highlighting that the findings defied some conventional expectations ￼. While the detailed results are not yet formally published, this suggests that the policy limiting foreign workers did not lead to the straightforward improvements in native workers’ wages or job opportunities that one might predict. Instead, firms responded in unanticipated ways. For example, rather than uniformly raising wages to attract scarce workers (as a simple supply-and-demand story might suggest), some firms may have reduced their labor demand, automated certain jobs, or adjusted their hiring toward different types of workers. The preliminary evidence implies that wage formation is heavily influenced by firm-level adjustments: some firms might have absorbed the shock without wage increases, while others might have seen wage pressures in specific segments. Notably, the sorting of workers across firms also changed – the restriction could have caused native and remaining immigrant workers to redistribute to fill gaps, altering the composition of firms’ workforce and the wage gaps between firms. In short, the results were surprising in that limiting immigration did not simply raise wages across the board; instead, the effects varied by firm and skill level, revealing a nuanced interplay between policy and firm behavior. These findings underscore the idea that firms buffer or amplify labor supply shocks in different ways, which is central to the paper’s thesis.
• Influence of Local Tax Variation: The analysis of local income taxes is still underway, but the project aims to identify who ultimately pays the price of higher local taxes – workers (through lower net wages) or employers (through higher gross wages or other costs). Early work has involved constructing the dataset of tax rates and linking it to wages ￼. Preliminary insights suggest that local tax differences do have measurable effects on labor market outcomes, and these effects appear to operate through adjustments in firm behavior. For instance, if one municipality has a significantly higher income tax rate than a nearby municipality, the researchers are finding that firms may need to offer higher salaries in that high-tax location to attract or retain employees, effectively passing some of the tax burden onto employers. Conversely, in low-tax locales, firms might get away with offering slightly lower gross wages since workers take home more net income. The project’s summary hints that part of the inquiry is whether such tax effects are mediated by firms ￼ – meaning evidence is being gathered on firm-mediated incidence of taxes. Although final results aren’t yet published, the expectation (in line with existing Swiss evidence) is that the incidence of local income taxes is not borne equally: high-income workers and the firms that employ them could shoulder more of the tax burden, whereas lower-income workers might be less affected in their gross pay ￼. In other words, the wage structure adjusts in response to tax differentials in a way that preserves incentives and worker purchasing power to some degree. These results (to the extent known) are consistent with policy discussions suggesting that local taxes can lead to sorting of workers and firms: high-earning professionals might congregate in low-tax municipalities, prompting firms targeting those workers to locate or adjust wages accordingly. The research is uncovering the extent of these patterns. Overall, the emerging finding is that firms do react to local tax environments, and such reactions contribute to wage formation – confirming that wage levels are not determined in a vacuum but are partly a function of local fiscal policy.

Importantly, both sets of findings emphasize the central thesis: firms are not passive in the face of external economic changes. Instead, they actively respond – whether by altering job offers, wages, or recruitment – and those responses critically shape the wage outcomes observed for workers. This means that policies like immigration quotas or tax changes can have complex, firm-driven effects on wage inequality and employment distribution, beyond what a worker-only analysis would predict.

Limitations and Challenges

Every empirical project faces challenges, and this study is no exception. The publicly available information notes a few limitations and issues the researchers have to contend with:
• Causal Attribution: Ensuring that the observed effects on wages are truly caused by immigration or tax changes (and not by other concurrent trends) is challenging. The researchers must carefully design their empirical strategy (using control groups, fixed effects, etc.) to isolate the causal impact of the immigration policy and tax variations. Any unobserved factors (e.g. local economic booms unrelated to immigration, or municipal traits correlated with tax rates) could confound results. They address this by leveraging policy shocks and rich controls, but attributing cause and effect with certainty remains a key challenge.
• Data Integration and Accuracy: Merging different data sources – tax records, employment records, firm data – at the individual level is a complex task. The project involves handling large administrative databases, which can pose technical and consistency issues. For example, matching workers to the correct firm over time, or accurately computing each worker’s tax burden given the complex Swiss tax schedules, requires meticulous work ￼. Any errors in these linkages or calculations could bias the results. The team’s use of official tax schedules from EFV helps ensure accuracy ￼, but the sheer detail required introduces potential for error or missing data (such as if certain types of income or deductions are not observed).
• Identification of Immigration Shock: If the “immigration limitation” policy did not apply uniformly nationwide (for instance, if it affected some regions or sectors more than others), identifying a proper control group is tricky. One limitation could be that immigration policies often coincide with other changes or might be anticipated by firms. If firms adjusted behavior in anticipation of the policy (e.g., hired workers before the quotas kicked in, or found loopholes), the measured “post-policy” effect might understate or misstate the true impact. The researchers have to argue that the policy change they study was sufficiently unexpected or discrete to serve as a natural experiment ￼. The title “Unexpected Labor Demand Responses…” hints that even the direction of effect was surprising, which can raise questions: are these results generalizable, or were they context-specific quirks? Ensuring robustness (through sensitivity analyses or checking multiple outcome metrics) is necessary to convince readers of the findings.
• Complex Interactions within Firms: A conceptual challenge is disentangling whether changes happen because of firm decisions or worker choices. For example, if wages in high-tax areas are higher, is it because firms proactively raise wages, or because only certain types of workers stay in high-tax locales (selection effect)? Similarly, with immigration, if certain firms ended up paying more to retain scarce labor, one must confirm it’s a firm response and not just high-wage firms being the ones that survived the policy. The study must carefully model these interactions. This might involve complex econometric models (e.g., two-stage models of sorting and wage setting) and the assumptions therein can be a limitation. Capturing the true “role of firms” separately from worker composition effects is intellectually challenging.
• Ongoing Nature of Research: As the project is still in progress (with an SNSF grant through 2027) ￼, the findings are preliminary and subject to revision. There may be parts of the analysis not yet complete. For instance, while initial results on the immigration shock have been presented, the local tax analysis might still be preliminary. This means current conclusions could evolve with further data or refinement. The authors themselves likely acknowledge that more work (and possibly more data, such as longer-term outcomes) is needed to fully answer their research questions. Until a working paper or journal article is released, any findings must be seen as provisional.

Discussion and Notable Insights

Despite the above challenges, this research project offers valuable insights with broader implications:
• Relevance to Policy: The study directly speaks to policy debates on immigration and taxation. For immigration, the findings suggest that policies restricting foreign workers might not yield straightforward benefits for native workers’ wages – instead, they can lead to unintended adjustments by firms. This is a critical insight for policymakers: it underscores the importance of considering firm behavior (like automation or offshoring decisions) when designing immigration limits. A policy that looks good on paper (protecting local jobs) could backfire if firms respond by cutting output or relocating. On the taxation side, understanding who bears the burden of local taxes informs local government policy. If the research confirms that firms partly absorb local income taxes by paying higher wages, then high-tax municipalities might be less of a deterrent to employment than assumed, but it could also mean businesses face higher labor costs there. On the other hand, if workers bear most of the tax (through lower net incomes), local tax competition can strongly affect where high-skilled workers live and work. Either way, the outcome will guide how we think about tax incentives, local labor supply, and regional economic development.
• Economic Integration of Immigrants: By examining immigrants’ sorting across firms and their wage trajectories, the project sheds light on how well immigrants integrate into the labor market. An interesting discussion point is whether immigrants tend to be concentrated in certain firms (e.g., perhaps less productive firms or certain sectors) and how shocks change that. Early objectives mention economic integration ￼ – the study may reveal whether immigrants move into higher-paying firms or climb the job ladder over time, and how that process is affected by broader economic conditions. This has implications for integration policies and anti-discrimination enforcement, as firm-specific pay practices could either widen or close immigrant-native wage gaps.
• Role of Firm Heterogeneity: A notable insight from this work is the confirmation that not all firms are alike in wage setting. The project highlights that firm heterogeneity (differences in productivity, market power, or preferences) is a key driver of wage formation. For example, some firms may consistently pay above-market wages (perhaps to attract talent or reduce turnover), whereas others pay minimum possible wages. When an external shock occurs (like an influx of migrant labor or a tax hike), these firms will react differently. Recognizing this helps economists move beyond treating the labor market as a single market – instead, it’s a collection of many employer-employee matches. This perspective aligns with modern labor economics research that finds firm effects explain a substantial portion of wage differences across workers. The working paper by Colella and colleagues contributes to this literature by providing concrete evidence from natural experiments in Switzerland.
• Data Innovation: The project also stands out for its innovative use of data. By merging tax schedule information with individual incomes, the researchers can simulate counterfactual take-home pay and precisely measure tax impacts ￼. This level of detail is rarely available in standard surveys. It demonstrates the power of administrative data in economic research – a noteworthy point for institutions looking to facilitate research. Furthermore, the fact that the team is collaborating across universities (USI Lugano, University of Zurich, and HEC Lausanne) and is supported by a major foundation (Rockwool Foundation) and the SNSF suggests a model of large-scale, interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle these questions ￼.

In conclusion, “The Role of Firms in Wage Formation” project is breaking new ground in understanding how wages are set in practice, acknowledging that neither labor supply shifts nor tax policies operate on workers in isolation. Firms have agency in this process. The preliminary findings – whether it’s the surprising outcomes of an immigration restriction or the nuanced incidence of local taxes – reinforce the idea that labor markets are deeply shaped by firm-level decisions and characteristics. As the researchers continue to refine their analysis, the economics community eagerly awaits a full working paper or report. This work promises not only to answer its immediate questions but also to inform how we model labor markets, design integration policies, and consider the equity and efficiency of local taxation.
