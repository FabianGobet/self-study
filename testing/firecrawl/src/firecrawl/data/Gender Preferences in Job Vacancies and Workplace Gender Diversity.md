Extensive Report on “Gender Preferences in Job Vacancies and Workplace Gender Diversity”

1. Introduction

This research paper examines the impact of a 2005 campaign by the Ombud for Equal Treatment (OET) in Austria which aimed to eliminate stated gender preferences (SGPs) in job advertisements. Although Austrian law had nominally outlawed such statements since the mid-1980s, explicit financial penalties were introduced in 2004. The OET’s efforts in 2005 rapidly drove the use of SGPs in vacancies from over 40% to below 5%. The authors merge data from Austria’s largest job board (administered by the Austrian Employment Service, AMS) with administrative firm-level records to see how the removal of explicit gender preferences affected: 1. The gender of hired workers for newly posted vacancies. 2. The gender diversity of workplaces and occupations. 3. Firm-level outcomes such as survival, growth, and wages.

The analysis relies on a difference-in-differences design that exploits pre-campaign data—where many ads did specify male- or female-only preferences—to infer how vacancies would have been posted in the absence of the new enforcement. In turn, the authors assess whether banning these statements actually changed hiring practices.

2. Scope and Key Ideas

2.1 Scope
• Setting: Austria, focusing on the online job board of the Austrian Employment Service (AMS).
• Time Frame: 2000–2010, capturing five years prior to and five years after the 2005 campaign.
• Firms and Occupations: All private-sector firms using the AMS platform; analysis pays special attention to “frequent posters,” i.e., firms posting multiple vacancies in the same occupation pre- and post-campaign.

2.2 Key Ideas 1. Elimination of Early-Stage Screening Signals
By removing a direct “shortcut” (stating “only men” or “only women” in a vacancy), job seekers of the non-preferred gender might be more likely to apply, potentially altering the ultimate hiring outcome. 2. Predicted vs. Actual Gender Preferences
After 2005, very few postings continued to use an explicit preference. Hence, the authors develop a predictive model using pre-campaign data—classifying each vacancy as likely male preference, likely female preference, or no preference—to see how these “predicted” preferences fared once SGPs were effectively banned. 3. Firm- and Occupation-Level Segregation
Prior to the campaign, most jobs specifying male preferences were in male-dominated occupations and workplaces, and similarly for female preferences. The question is whether banning explicit SGPs reduces overall gender segregation—or simply leads to the same hires without overtly stating gender requirements.

3. Goals and Major Objectives
    1. Measure the Direct Impact on Hiring Outcomes
       • Did banning stated gender preferences change the gender of the person ultimately hired for the job?
       • How large were these changes, if any?
    2. Examine Heterogeneous Effects
       • Stereotypical vs. Non-Stereotypical Preferences: Distinguishing between, for instance, “male preference in a male-dominated occupation” versus “female preference in a male-dominated occupation” can uncover different dynamics.
       • Small vs. Large Firms: Does firm size matter for how strongly the ban affected hiring or job durations?
    3. Assess Long-Run Consequences at the Firm Level
       • Changes in the share of female employees (or male, if a firm historically advertised for women) after the campaign.
       • Potential effects on firm survival, employment growth, and average wages.

4. Methodology

4.1 Data Sources
• AMS Job Board Data
Includes over half of all vacancies in Austria. Each posting specifies occupation, firm details, employment conditions (e.g., full- vs. part-time), and before 2005, an employer-selected “preferred gender.”
• Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD)
Matched to AMS-filled vacancies (i.e., vacancies for which an AMS client was hired). This matching allows the authors to see:
• The actual gender of the worker eventually hired.
• Longer-term outcomes: job duration, firm-level characteristics, etc.

4.2 Empirical Strategy 1. Prediction of Gender Preferences
• Pre-Campaign (2000–2004): Record whether a vacancy actually stated “male,” “female,” or “no preference.”
• Model: For each firm-occupation combination, calculate how often a male or female preference was used in 2000–2004. This leave-out mean effectively becomes the “predicted gender preference” for subsequent vacancies in the same firm-occupation cell, even after SGPs were removed. 2. Difference-in-Differences
• Treatment Group(s): Vacancies that, based on pre-campaign patterns, would have indicated male or female preferences.
• Comparison Group: Vacancies that, based on pre-campaign patterns, would not have used any preference.
• Outcome: Probability of hiring a female (or male), time to fill the vacancy, wages of the hire, etc.
• Periods:
• Pre-Campaign: 2000–2004 (before the OET’s information drive).
• Post-Campaign: 2006–2010 (after the near-disappearance of SGPs).
• 2005 is often excluded in a transition “event study” framework because it is precisely when the OET campaign began. 3. Event Study Approach
To check for pre-existing trends, the authors plot year-by-year differences in outcomes for predicted male or female preference vacancies relative to no-preference vacancies. Lack of any divergence before 2005 increases confidence in a causal interpretation.

5. Key Findings and Results

5.1 Collapse of Stated Gender Preferences
• Before the Campaign: Around 40% of AMS-posted vacancies specified an explicit preference (e.g., “men only” or “women only”).
• After the Campaign: By mid-2006, well under 5% of vacancies used SGPs. The transformation happened rapidly during 2005—exactly when the OET launched its information drive.

5.2 Changes in Hiring Outcomes 1. Overall Effects on the Gender of Hires
• Vacancies with Predicted Male Preferences: The share of women hired rose by roughly 2–3 percentage points (relative to “no preference” vacancies).
• Vacancies with Predicted Female Preferences: The share of men hired rose by around 3–4 percentage points (again relative to “no preference” vacancies). 2. Magnitude of the Effects
The authors note their predictive model “attenuates” the true treatment effect. For positions that definitely would have stated a preference, the implied increase in hiring the “opposite” gender is about twice as large (e.g., ~5–7 percentage points). 3. Stereotypical vs. Non-Stereotypical Preferences
• Stereotypical Case (e.g., male preference in a male-dominated occupation): Banning SGPs tended to boost hiring of the less-common gender in that occupation. This improves diversity overall.
• Non-Stereotypical Case (e.g., female preference in a male-dominated occupation): Eliminating the explicit preference often reduced the firm’s odds of hiring that rarer gender, thereby decreasing occupational diversity.

In other words, the ban did not universally promote diversity at the occupation level when firms were trying to recruit a minority gender. However, at the firm level, there can still be offsetting gains in diversity (e.g., a predominantly male firm that tried to hire a male for a female-dominated occupation now might attract more female applicants, boosting the female share overall).

5.3 No Negative Impacts on Firms’ Longer-Run Outcomes
• Firm Survival and Growth: The paper finds no evidence that forcing gender-neutral postings harmed (or helped) a firm’s survival rate or net employment levels.
• Wages: Similarly, average wages at firms that heavily used male or female preferences did not appear to be adversely affected after the campaign.

5.4 Implications
• Signaling in Job Ads: Removing an explicit gender requirement alters the applicant pool and ultimately modifies hiring outcomes, consistent with a scenario in which many qualified candidates of the “non-preferred” gender would otherwise never apply.
• Policy Relevance: While the campaign targeted a form of early-stage “steering” or “screening,” it effectively changed the labor-market composition—especially in stereotypically gendered occupations—without reducing firm performance.

6. Key Problems, Limitations, and Hinderances
    1. Measurement Challenges
       • Prediction vs. Actual Preferences: Post-2005, very few vacancies stated a preference, so the authors had to rely on pre-campaign patterns to infer “would-be” preferences. This introduces potential misclassification and attenuation of the real effects.
    2. General Equilibrium Considerations
       • The analysis cannot fully capture system-wide ripple effects if the labor market and application patterns changed overall. Some of these broader shifts are outside the scope of the data.
    3. Sample Restrictions
       • The main vacancy-level analysis focuses on “frequent posting” firms (those with multiple openings pre- and post-campaign in the same occupation). Smaller firms, or those that post rarely, might respond differently.
    4. Occupational Text Data
       • The AMS system only provides a pre-set “gender preference” field (now largely unused) and standard job classifications. The study cannot account for subtle text-based signals within job titles or descriptions (e.g., use of feminine vs. masculine occupational nouns in the German language) once the preference field was phased out.
    5. Non-Stereotypical Preferences
       • In principle, a desire to diversify the workforce could have motivated some “non-stereotypical” preferences. The analysis suggests that banning explicit preferences sometimes reduces such diversity. Detailed intentions on the employer side are unobserved and thus remain partly speculative.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, the authors document how a 2005 enforcement campaign in Austria virtually eradicated stated gender preferences in job ads—and in so doing, meaningfully altered hiring outcomes. Their difference-in-differences estimates show that removing gender-specific requirements increased the likelihood of hiring a candidate from the formerly “excluded” gender. On average, the share of female hires rose for vacancies predicted to prefer men, and vice versa. The net effect was a moderate reduction in occupational gender segregation for “stereotypical” vacancies. At the firm level, companies more prone to specifying a male or female preference nonetheless saw increases in the share of their minority-gender employees, with no evidence of adverse effects on survival, employment growth, or average wages.

This research highlights how seemingly small signals—like stating “we want a male/female candidate”—affect applicant self-selection and, ultimately, hiring. The authors’ findings underscore that even a policy change that only bans certain stated preferences can shift hiring decisions and labor-market outcomes in a meaningful, measurable way.
